# Introduction

# Practical Work
## Model selection

At first we try some simple models with few added layers. For example those are the results of a model with a `Dropout` layer with a rate of 0.3 followed by a `Dense` layer with 16 neurons and 4 epochs. We can see that the performances are not really good:

It is even worse if the complexity is too high. With two `Dense` layers, with 256 and 512 neurons each, in between two `Dropout` layers with rates of 0.3 and 0.2, we can observe that the loss is awful:
